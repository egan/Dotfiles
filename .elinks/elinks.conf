## ELinks 0.13.GIT configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

# Automatically saved options
#

## config 
#  Configuration handling options.

  ## config.saving_style_w [0|1]
  #  This is internal option used when displaying a warning about obsolete
  #  config.saving_style. You shouldn't touch it.
  set config.saving_style_w = 1


## document 
#  Document options.

  ## document.uri_passing 
  #  Rules for passing URIs to external commands. When one rule is defined the
  #  link and tab menu will have a menu item that makes it possible to pass the
  #  the link, frame or tab URI to an external command. If several rules are
  #  defined the link and tab menu will have a submenu of items for each rule.
  #  
  #  Note, this is mostly useful for launching graphical viewers, since there is
  #  no support for releasing the terminal while the command runs. The action
  #  and submenus are also available by binding keys to the
  #  frame-external-command, the link-external-command, and the
  #  tab-external-command actions.

    ## document.uri_passing.dwb <str>
    #  A rule for passing URI to an external command. The format is:
    #  %c in the string means the current URL
    #  %% in the string means '%'
    #  Do _not_ put single- or double-quotes around %c.
    set document.uri_passing.dwb = "dwb %c"



## ui 
#  User interface options.

  ## ui.language <language>
  #  Language of user interface. 'System' means that the language will be
  #  extracted from the environment dynamically.
  set ui.language = "System"
