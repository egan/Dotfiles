Dotfiles
==================
These configuration files are used on all my Arch Linux installations.
Some further editing may be required on foreign systems.

.mutt/
------------------
My mutt configuration for Gmail via IMAPS and SMTP .

.bash_aliases
------------------
Contains a variety of aliases to make the command line more user friendly.
A few require scripts from my scripts repository.
Many are idiosyncratic and won't be much use to others.

.bash_profile
------------------
Sets some useful environment variables and loads ~/.bashrc.
It might not be warranted to replace your local copy herewith.
However, my other files assume this file is in use.

.bashrc
------------------
Spartan bash configuration, enabling some extended features and disabling history.
May require slightly different paths to work on other operating systems.
Merging this file with your local copy deliberately would be best.
