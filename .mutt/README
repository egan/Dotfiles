Mutt Configuration
==================
This is my fairly usable mutt configuration for Gmail via IMAPS and SMTP.

To install, create .mutt/{cache/bodies/,certificates/,temp/} and touch .mutt/cache/headers.
Furthermore, the files .mutt/{aliases,contacts,signature} should be properly populated.

Change the fields "REAL NAME", "EMAIL.USER", and "GMAILPASSWORD" to reflect you.

Though mutt can handle multiple accounts via account and folder hooks, it is a PITA.
For something easier, I recommend multiple configuration files, sourced by mutt -F.
Running multiple instances of mutt in tmux or another terminal multiplexer works nicely.
