Weechat Configuration
=====================
To install, copy these files while weechat is not running, as it overwrites
configuration files upon exit.

Change the strings "NICK*" "USER" "PASSWORD" and "REAL NAME" to reflect you in
alias.conf and irc.conf. If you do not wish to have autocommands for the
included DALnet and Freenode configurations, just replace the appropriate
values with an empty string.
