# Archive
These are archived configuration files that I no longer use, usually because I
have migrated to a new software package, or aborted a migration.

## .config
Configuration for some (mostly graphical) applications. See README.

## .conkyrc
Experimental configuration for conky when I was first looking for a status bar
(now fulfilled by xmobar).

##.pentadactylrc
Basic pentadactyl configuration, as well as some useful mappings. I have since
migrated to vimfx.

## .xmonad/
Fully functional xmonad configuration I used for 5 years before migrating to
spectrwm. See README.

## .zsh\_aliases
2010 snapshot of bash aliases migrated to zsh during my short experimentation.

## .zshrc
Basic zsh configuration.
